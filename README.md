# CreditRisk_Classification
In this project we are going to use classification algorithms to predict whether the extended credit will lead to profitability or losses for the institution.

## Classification Models
The classification models used in this notebook are the following:
- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- Decision tree
- SVC
## Metrics used for evaluation
in this case scenario we are going to use  the "Accuracy classification score" In binary classification, this function is equal to the jaccard_score function you can read about jaccard score  [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.jaccard_score.html).

## Conclusions
Binary classification are very straight foward applications for machhine learning but based on our scores, the best models for this data set are logistic regresion and SVC.
Another thing we can highlight is that debt income ratio, credit debt reatio and other debts in the credit history are the most influential variables.
